# Simon Says Game

A simple and interactive "Simon Says" game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player has to repeat a sequence of colors in the correct order. The sequence gets longer with each round, increasing the difficulty.

## How to Play

1. **Open the Game:**
   - Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You'll see the game interface with four colored buttons (green, red, yellow, blue), a "Start Game" button, and a message area.

2. **Start the Game:**
   - Click the "Start Game" button to begin. The game will display a sequence of colors.

3. **Watch the Sequence:**
   - Pay attention to the sequence of colors that light up. Remember the order.

4. **Repeat the Sequence:**
   - After the sequence is shown, click the colored buttons in the same order as displayed.

5. **Advance to the Next Level:**
   - If you correctly repeat the sequence, the game will generate a new, longer sequence. Continue repeating the sequences as they get longer and more complex.

6. **Game Over:**
   - If you click a button out of order, the game ends, and a "Game Over" message is displayed. Click "Start Game" to try again.
